# Cursorless Tree sitter wasms

Repository building wasms for use by Cursorless.

Instructions for adding new parser wasms (WIP):

- Add the tree-sitter package for the specific language to `package.json` directly, or use pnpm to do so. 

- If a build failure of some sort occurs, you will need to utilize the special build options in `build.ts`, specifically in the `processParser` function. If you can't figure it out, leave the PR as a draft and ask for help.
